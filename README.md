# cinspect-mode
Use [cinspect](https://github.com/punchagan/cinspect) to look at the CPython source of builtins and other C objects!

`cinspect-mode` can and optimally should be used in concert with [Jedi.el](http://tkf.github.io/emacs-jedi).

In addition to being a great asset for python editing in general, Jedi.el lets us trace the object we're looking at to the source:

With Jedi.el:
```python
# TODO
```
